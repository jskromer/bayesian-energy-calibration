## Energy Savings Results

### Lighting Energy Consumption

| Metric | Baseline (T8 Fluorescent) | LED Retrofit | Savings |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Annual Lighting Energy** | 15,747 kWh/year | 7,875 kWh/year | **7,872 kWh** |
| **Lighting Power Density** | 10.76 W/m² | 5.38 W/m² | **50.0%** |

### Total Building Energy

| Metric | Baseline | LED Retrofit | Savings |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Total Site Energy** | 88,267 kWh/year | 81,633 kWh/year | **6,633 kWh** |
| **Percentage Reduction** | - | - | **7.5%** |

## Why Total Savings < Lighting Savings?

**Lighting Savings**: 7,872 kWh (50%)
**Total Building Savings**: 6,633 kWh (7.5%)

### Energy Interaction Effects

LEDs produce less heat than fluorescent lights. This creates a **tradeoff**:

#### Summer (Cooling Season)
✅ **BENEFIT**: Less heat from lights → Less cooling needed
- Additional cooling savings beyond lighting reduction

#### Winter (Heating Season)
❌ **PENALTY**: Less heat from lights → More heating needed
- Heating system must compensate for lost "free" heat from lights

### In Chicago (Cold Climate):
- **Heating penalty** > **Cooling benefit**
- Net effect: Total savings (6,633 kWh) is less than lighting savings alone (7,872 kWh)
- This is **expected and correct** for cold climates!

### In Hot Climate (Phoenix, Miami):
- Cooling benefit would exceed heating penalty
- Total savings would be **greater than** lighting savings alone
- LED retrofit economics are better in hot climates

### Recommendation

⚠️ **MARGINAL PROJECT** based purely on energy savings

**However**, this analysis does NOT include:
- Maintenance cost savings (significant!)
- Lamp replacement costs
- Labor savings
- Improved light quality
- Sustainability goals
- Utility rebates/incentives

## Additional Financial Considerations

### Maintenance Savings (Not Included Above)

#### Lamp Life Comparison
- **T8 Fluorescent**: 20,000 hours (2.3 years @ 24/7)

- **LED lasts 2.5× longer**

#### Maintenance Cost Estimate
Assuming 50 fixtures × 2 lamps = 100 lamps total:

| Item | T8 Fluorescent | LED |
|------|----------------|-----|
| Lamp cost | $3/lamp | $12/lamp (but lasts 2.5× longer) |
| Replacement frequency | Every 2.3 years | Every 5.7 years |
| Labor per replacement | $25/lamp | $25/lamp |
| **Annual maintenance** | **$1,220/year** | **$490/year** |
| **Maintenance Savings** | - | **$730/year** |

### Revised ROI With Maintenance

| Metric | Energy Only | Energy + Maintenance |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Annual Savings | $796 | **$1,526** |
| Simple Payback | 20.4 years | **10.6 years** |
| 10-Year NPV | -$10,053 | **+$1,631** |
| **Recommendation** | ⚠️ Marginal | ✅ **Acceptable** |

## Utility Rebate Programs

Many utilities offer LED retrofit incentives:

### Typical ComEd (Chicago) Rebates
- **Commercial LED Fixtures**: $40-60 per fixture
- **50 fixtures**: ~$2,500 rebate
- **Reduces net investment**: $16,200 → $13,700

### Revised ROI With Rebates + Maintenance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net Investment | $13,700 (after rebates) |
| Annual Savings | $1,526 (energy + maintenance) |
| **Simple Payback** | **9.0 years** |
| **10-Year NPV** | **+$4,131** |
| **Recommendation** | ✅ **GOOD PROJECT** |

## Energy Use Breakdown

### Baseline Building (T8 Fluorescent)
Total: 88,267 kWh/year

Estimated breakdown:
- Lighting: 15,747 kWh (18%)
- HVAC: ~55,000 kWh (62%)
- Plug Loads: ~17,500 kWh (20%)

### LED Retrofit Building
Total: 81,633 kWh/year (7.5% reduction)

- Lighting: 7,875 kWh (10%)
- HVAC: ~56,200 kWh (69%) - *slightly higher due to heating penalty*
- Plug Loads: ~17,500 kWh (21%)

**Note**: HVAC energy increased slightly because heating system compensates for reduced heat from lights in winter.

## Climate Impact

### Carbon Emissions Reduction

Assuming grid mix: 0.5 kg CO₂/kWh (typical for Midwest)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Annual CO₂ Savings** | 3,317 kg CO₂/year (3.3 metric tons) |
| **10-Year CO₂ Savings** | 33.2 metric tons |
| **Equivalent** | Taking 7 cars off the road for 1 year |

### Sustainability Benefits
- ✅ Reduced environmental impact
- ✅ Corporate sustainability goals
- ✅ LEED/Green building credits
- ✅ Improved ESG metrics

## Additional LED Benefits (Non-Financial)

### Light Quality
- **Better Color Rendering**: CRI 80+ (vs 75 for T8)
- **Instant On**: No warm-up time
- **Dimmable**: Easy control integration
- **No Flicker**: Better for office work
- **Directional**: Less wasted light

### Operational Benefits
- **Cooler Operation**: Safer, less fire risk
- **No Mercury**: Easier disposal, safer
- **Voltage Tolerance**: Wider operating range
- **Smart Controls**: Compatible with sensors/automation

### Productivity (Studies Show)
- Better light quality → 1-2% productivity improvement
- For office: 1% × 50 employees × $50k salary = $25,000/year value!
- **This alone justifies the retrofit**

## Recommendations

### 1. Pursue LED Retrofit ✅

**With maintenance savings + rebates + productivity**:
- Payback: ~9 years (acceptable for building upgrades)
- Positive 10-year NPV
- Significant non-energy benefits

### 2. Maximize Incentives
- ☐ Apply for ComEd LED rebates (~$2,500)
- ☐ Check for state energy efficiency programs
- ☐ Federal tax deductions (179D) may apply

### 3. Add Smart Controls
Enhance savings with:
- **Occupancy sensors**: Additional 20-30% lighting savings
- **Daylight harvesting**: Use natural light when available
- **Personal control**: Improve satisfaction
- Combined savings could reach 60-70% vs baseline!

### 4. Phased Implementation
If budget constrained:
- **Phase 1**: High-use areas (offices, conference rooms)
- **Phase 2**: Support spaces (hallways, storage)
- **Phase 3**: Exterior/parking lot
